# Fast-ramping Ru/(BaO)-(CaO)-(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) catalysts for ammonia synthesis
This repository contains data, code, and analysis for a study of Ru/(BaO)-(CaO)-(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) catalysts for ammonia synthesis. A journal article describing the full study in detail is in preparation.

## Methods
* (BaO)<sub>x</sub>-(CaO)<sub>y</sub>-(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>1-x-y</sub> (BCA) catalyst supports were synthesized via sol-gel and solid-state methods. 
* Ru/BCA catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation to achieve 1 wt. % Ru loading.
* Ammonia production rates were measured for Ru/BCA catalysts in a packed-bed reactor at temperatures up to 600<sup>o</sup>C and flow rates up to 20 SLM.
* A machine learning (ML) model was employed to improve understanding of the behavior of Ru/BCA catalysts.
* A microkinetic model was developed to describe the best-performing catalyst.

* A novel catalyst, Ru/(BaO)<sub>2</sub>(CaO)(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) (Ru/B2CA), was identified, which exhibits exceptional ammonia formation rates up to 200 mmol/g*h (Fig. 1a).
* ML analysis revealed a distinct volcano relationship between ammonia formation rate and a specialized descriptor, the mean (metal-oxygen)-(metal-nitrogen) bond energy delta, which serves as a proxy for nitrogen adsorption energy on the BCA support (Fig. 1d). This relationship is highly reminiscent of the volcano relationship between turnover frequency and nitrogen adsoprtion energy for unsupported metal catalysts (Fig. 1d, inset).
* The volcano relationship suggests that BCA supports with optimal (metal-oxygen)-(metal-nitrogen) bond energy deltas are able to boost synthesis rates by adsorbing nitrogen directly, removing the nitrogen adsorption bottleneck observed for typical ammonia synthesis catalysts (Fig. 2).
* The microkinetic model for Ru/B2CA revealed that (1) nitrogen adsorption is not the rate-limiting step in ammonia synthesis over Ru/B2CA and (2) the Ru surface is rich with adsorbed nitrogen, lending support to the mechanistic hypothesis derived from the ML model.

Right: we hypothesize that the B2CA support is able to adsorb nitrogen directly (either on its surface or on a B2CA adlayer on the Ru surface), providing a ready supply of adsorbed nitrogen to the Ru surface.*
